					<p class="textleft">Looking for interesting projects to do with a LCD display and Arduino, I found there is a big number
						of Handheld Retro Game Consoles, and I was instantly excited about the idea to make my own.
						<br>This wasn't as easy as it seemed. But I learnt a lot working on this.
						<br><br>I didn't start from cratch. I used the Gamebuino libraries from Github, and did all the needed modifications to work 
						with the different components I had. 
						<br>The main difficulty was adpating the existing libraries to work with my LCD, which has an 8bit parallel connection, 
						instead of SPI. So, I used the Gamebuino library mixed with the display library, to make the graphics work.
						<br>And they do work, up to some point, at least. There are still some things I'm figuring out.
